# CrackingTheCodingInterview
A collection of the programming questions I have solved in the 5th edition of Cracking the Coding Interview, with original questions commented. Solutions are all in Python with detailed explanations. 

Feel free to utilize this repo as a way to prepare for your own interview or if you'd like to see how I reach a solution. I try my best to put my entire thought process behind why I write a line of code that isn't otherwise straightforward. I have already grown so much simply by completing these questions, and I am always open to critique. Ultimately this exercise is about becoming a better programmer, so please, reach out to me for suggestions or questions!
